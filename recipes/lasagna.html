        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Tender sheets of pasta, a creamy ricotta cheese filling, and a rich
          meaty tomato sauce are all topped with more cheese and baked until
          browned and bubbly. This recipe has been passed down for generations.
          It has bold flavors that always hit the spot. I hope your family
          enjoys this as much as mine does!

            <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese, 2 cups</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>¾ cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>

            <li>¼ tsp pepper</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Meat sauce</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion, finely diced</li>
            <li>¾ lb. ground beef</li>
            <li>¾ lb. ground Italian sausage</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>40 oz. marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Lasagna</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
          <li>2.5 cup mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Prep work</h4>
        <p>
          Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside.
          Measure out remaining ingredients.

        <h4>Making the meat sauce</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them
            soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar
            which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high.
            Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and
            crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic
            during the last minute. Drain excess grease.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the
            bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste,
            hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to
            a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Preheat Oven and Cook the Lasagna Noodles</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 375°.</li>
          <li>
            Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water for the lasagna
            noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, cook the noodles to al dente
            according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don’t
            overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking
            to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain and rinse with cold
            water until noodles are completely cool.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you
            begin assembling the lasagna.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Assemble</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch
            casserole dish. Next, add 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping them if
            needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed
            by about 1 ½ cups of meat sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Top with 4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture,
            1 ½ cups meat sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finish with 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture,
            and the rest of the meat sauce.
          </li>
          <li>Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese.</li>
          <li>
            Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray and place it spray-side-down
            on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Bake</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Bake for 35 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 10 more minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. Let it sit for 15 minutes
            prior to serving to allow the layers to set. Serve with garlic bread
            with cheese.
          </li>
