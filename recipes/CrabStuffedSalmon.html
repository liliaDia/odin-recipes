    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Calling all seafood-lovers! This restaurant-quality crab-stuffed salmon
      can be made at home in under 40 minutes and tastes just like the real
      deal. The key to creating this luxurious dish at home is starting with
      great seafood. Thick salmon fillets and jumbo lump crab meat are the
      stars. This recipe adds just enough to elevate their flavors without
      overpowering the fresh seafood taste. For a dish so elegant, it’s not
      fussy in the slightest. You’ll simply mix together a filling of lump crab
      meat, Ritz cracker crumbs, mayonnaise, whole grain mustard, lemon juice,
      parsley, Old Bay seasoning, and black pepper. To be able to stuff each
      fillet, you’ll cut a pocket through to the very bottom of each salmon
      fillet instead of just a slit on the surface. This makes stuffing easier
      and also reduces cooking time.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 bunch fresh parsley</li>
      <li>10 Ritz or butter crackers (about 1 ounce)</li>
      <li>4 (about 6-ounce, at least 1-inch thick) skinless salmon fillets</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons Old Bay seasoning, divided</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1/2 medium lemon</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon whole grain mustard</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>8 ounces jumbo lump crab meat</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the sauce (optional)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1/2 medium lemon</li>
      <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon whole grain mustard (optional)</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 350°F.
        Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pick and finely chop the leaves from 1/2 bunch fresh parsley leaves
        until you have about 1/2 cup. Place 10 Ritz crackers in a small zip-top
        bag, press out the air, and seal the bag. Crush the crackers a rolling
        pin or bottom of a saucepan into crumbs (about 1/3 cup).
      </li>
      <li>
        Pat 4 skinless salmon fillets dry with paper towels, then place on the
        baking sheet. Starting 1 inch from one end, cut a slit down the center
        of each fillet lengthwise, cutting all the way through to the bottom and
        stopping 1 inch from the other end to make a pocket. Season the salmon
        with 2 teaspoons of the Old Bay seasoning and 1 tablespoon olive oil,
        then rub to distribute evenly on all sides of the salmon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Squeeze the juice of 1/2 medium lemon into a medium bowl until you have
        1 tablespoon. Add the remaining 2 teaspoons Old Bay seasoning, 2
        tablespoons mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon whole grain mustard, and 1/2
        teaspoon black pepper. Stir until well combined. Drain 8 ounces jumbo
        lump crab meat (about 2 cups). Add the crab, cracker crumbs, and half of
        the parsley. Fold until well combined. Stuff the filling into the salmon
        pockets (about 1/2 cup each).
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake until the salmon registers 120º F on an instant-read thermometer
        for medium rare. Meanwhile, make the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut 8 tablespoons unsalted butter into 4 pieces and place in a small
        saucepan. Melt over medium heat. (Alternatively, melt in the microwave
        in 10-second bursts.) Squeeze the juice from 1/2 medium lemon until you
        have 1 1/2 teaspoons.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the lemon juice, 3 large egg yolks, 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard, 1/2
        teaspoon whole grain mustard if using, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/8
        teaspoon cayenne if using in a blender or tall liquid measuring cup if
        using an immersion blender. Blend on medium speed until combined, 5 to
        10 seconds. With the blender on medium speed, slowly pour in the hot
        butter and blend until pale yellow and emulsified, 45 to 60 seconds.
        Serve the sauce over the salmon and garnish with the remaining parsley.
