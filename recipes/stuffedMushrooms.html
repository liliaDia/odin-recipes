          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            To make one of our favorite party appetizers, we stuffed baby bella
            mushrooms with garlicky, herby breadcrumbs and two types of cheese.
            The result? The most irresistible holiday appetizer that just might
            disappear before your main course appears. This easy appetizer adds
            a bit of fancy flare to your spread, whether you're serving them at
            your Christmas dinner or New Year's celebration.
